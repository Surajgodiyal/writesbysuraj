        <h2>Diary Entry 2: March 5, 2025</h2>
        <p><strong>Dear Diary,</strong></p>
        <p>Something weird happened today. It was just a random encounter in the library, but it shook me more than I expected.</p>
        <p>I was sitting at the back, mindlessly scrolling through my phone, when an older guy came and sat next to me. He looked like he was in his late twenties, dressed in this worn-out jacket and carrying a pile of books. I wasn’t paying much attention until he started talking to me about a book I was reading. The book didn’t even seem that special, just something I picked up on a whim, but he talked about it like it was the key to understanding the universe.</p>
        <p>He asked me what I thought about life, about purpose. I gave him the usual answer—“I don’t know, just trying to get through college,” but he didn’t seem satisfied.</p>
        <p>“You know,” he said, “Life is not just about getting through it. It’s about truly being here. You won’t realize it now, but there’s a point where you either wake up or keep sleeping through it. Don’t let the noise drown out your thoughts.”</p>
        <p>I didn’t know how to respond. The guy was a stranger, yet his words stuck with me the rest of the day. Maybe I’m just overthinking things, but it felt like a wake-up call. I don’t even know why I’m writing this down. Maybe I’m just confused.</p>
