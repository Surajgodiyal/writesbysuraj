        <h2>Diary Entry 1: March 2, 2025</h2>
        <p><strong>Dear Diary,</strong></p>
        <p>I don’t know why I’m writing today, maybe because I need to get this out of my head. Things have been a mess lately, but I think I’m finally realizing that I need to change something about myself.</p>
        <p>College life is all about the routine—classes, assignments, and of course, spending time with my friends. Jit and I hang out a lot. He’s the one person I trust most. The others, we joke around, but deep down, I know they don’t get me. Everyone talks about “getting ahead” and “doing what’s right for the future,” but it feels like we’re all just going through the motions, pretending to be serious about things we don’t even care about. Sometimes I wonder if anyone else feels the same.</p>
        <p>Lately, I’ve been thinking about what it means to really live, to actually feel alive. It’s like I’m stuck in a loop, just following the steps without ever asking myself if this is what I want.</p>
        <p>Anyway, enough of that. Just had to get it off my chest. I think I’ll focus on the stuff I *can* control, like making sure I don't flunk this semester.</p>
